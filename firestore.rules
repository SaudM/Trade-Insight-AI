/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All data is nested under
 * /users/{userId}, and only the authenticated user with a matching UID can
 * read and write their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId} to ensure user-level data isolation.
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 *  - /users/{userId}/tradeLogs/{tradeLogId}: Stores individual trade log entries.
 *  - /users/{userId}/dailyAnalyses/{dailyAnalysisId}: Stores AI-generated daily analysis.
 *  - /users/{userId}/weeklyReviews/{weeklyReviewId}: Stores weekly review reports.
 *  - /users/{userId}/weeklyReviews/{weeklyReviewId}/weeklyImprovementPlan: Stores weekly improvement plans.
 *  - /users/{userId}/monthlySummaries/{monthlySummaryId}: Stores monthly summary reports.
 *  - /users/{userId}/subscription/current: Singleton document storing the user's current subscription.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized enumeration of user accounts.
 *  - Strict ownership is enforced on all write operations to prevent data modification by other users.
