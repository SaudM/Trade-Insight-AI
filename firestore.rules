/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/subscription/current: User's current subscription. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /users/{userId}/tradeLogs/{tradeLogId}: Trade log entries. Only the user can read/write their own logs.
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyAnalyses/{dailyAnalysisId}: Daily analysis reports. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /users/{userId}/weeklyReviews/{weeklyReviewId}: Weekly review reports. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /users/{userId}/weeklyReviews/{weeklyReviewId}/weeklyImprovementPlan: Weekly improvement plans. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /users/{userId}/monthlySummaries/{monthlySummaryId}: Monthly summaries. Only the user can read/write.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is isolated using path-based ownership.
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - The rules do NOT validate the data model (data types, required fields) except for ownership and relational integrity.
 *   The data shape is flexible to allow for rapid prototyping.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled by ownership checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules rely on path-based ownership, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to parent documents.
