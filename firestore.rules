/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring only the authenticated user
 * can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/subscription/current: Stores the user's current subscription.
 * - /users/{userId}/tradeLogs/{tradeLogId}: Stores individual trade log entries.
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyAnalyses/{dailyAnalysisId}: Stores daily analysis reports.
 * - /users/{userId}/weeklyReviews/{weeklyReviewId}: Stores weekly review reports.
 * - /users/{userId}/weeklyReviews/{weeklyReviewId}/weeklyImprovementPlan: Stores weekly improvement plans.
 * - /users/{userId}/monthlySummaries/{monthlySummaryId}: Stores monthly summaries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations are restricted to the authenticated user matching the path's userId.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototype phase, focusing on authorization.
